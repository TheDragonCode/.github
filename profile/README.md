<h1 align="center">The Dragon Code</h1>

The Dragon Code are powerful functional solutions with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. The Dragon Code packages takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Performing [actions](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/laravel-migration-actions) during deployment
- Providing [JSON responses](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/api-response) in a unified way
- [Extending](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/extended-routes) resource routes
- Help with [migrating](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/migrate-db) to another database
- Display of [all routes](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/pretty-routes) with convenient filtering and sorting
- Collection of all [environment settings keys](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/env-sync-laravel)
- Convenient assistant when working with the [cache](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/laravel-cache)
- Easy redefinition of all [responses](https://github.com/TheDragonCode/laravel-json-response) in JSON (for restful api)
- and much more.

We also have Telegram channels where we post announcements:

- [English](https://t.me/dragon_code_news_en)
- [Русский](https://t.me/dragon_code_news)

And we have a [service](https://preview.dragon-code.pro) where you can choose a preview for your repository.
